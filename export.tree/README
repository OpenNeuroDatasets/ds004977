Currently, this dataset contains the raw data needed to generate all results EXCEPT for those pertaining to figures 7 and 8 (unavailable data samples are censored with 0). The complete data are currently being used to answer other scientific questions, and will be released in time with other manuscripts.

## Format
Data are formatted according to BIDS version 1.14.0

## Single pulse stimulation
The patient were resting in the hospital bed, while single pulse stimulation was performed with a frequency of ~0.2 Hz. The stimulation had a duration of 200 microseconds, was biphasic and had an amplitude of 6mA.
